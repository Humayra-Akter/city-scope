Problem Scenario:
Let's say you are visiting a place for the first time, or some new shops have opened in your locality and are giving offers, or some event is going to happen, but you don’t know about them yet!!! So now if you search about that location:
Most times Google doesn’t show locality-wise actual information.
Also finding popular foods, places, or other entities by searching Google is time-consuming and most often very hard to find.  
More importantly, often people don’t even know what to search for such as they want to eat popular foods in Khulna, but don’t know what are. So they can’t search about it properly.
